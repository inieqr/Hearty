# UniHeart ❤️

Each year, 659,000 people in the United States alone die from heart disease, which makes heart disease the leading cause of death. **UniHeart** is a web app that allows for the early detection of heart disease using 2 machine learning algorithms, all coded from scratch. 

## Features
2 Machine Learning Models: a environmental model & a laboratory model. Both models were developed from scratch using no previous machine learning libraries. 

### Environmental Model
- Everyday user friendly (questions that aren't as technical)
- 61% accuracy

### Lab Model
- Designed for doctors and requires filling out questions that may only be able to be answered through medical tests
- 85% accuracy
